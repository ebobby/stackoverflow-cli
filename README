*stackoverflow-cli* is a command line interface to the stackoverflow API designed to be run in text environments in combination with other GNU tools to extract useful information.

To compile this thing you need libcurl and json-c libraries, downnload the code and run the Makefile.

No configure script yet.

Right now only the --search command is working, I plan on implementing more like --user and --question, contributions are more than welcome if I picked your interested feel free to send patches and/or pull requests.
